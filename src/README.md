# GA WDI-32 Project 1 - Ant Words

For our first project, we were given four days to design and build an in-browser game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery library used). WeeWords was a product of my own imagination, rather than a remake of an existing game. It requires the player to enter words made up of letters randomly appearing on screen, and features 3 levels with specific win conditions.

##### [Visit website](https://wee-words.herokuapp.com/) for best playing experience (the game was not designed for mobile).

###### WeeWords takes place in a 100% CSS-built and animated environment, with the weather changing on each level as the player progresses.

###### Level one gives the player 30 seconds to fulfil the required score, using any letters they can see on screen. The letters are picked at random from a weighted alphabet (so that you get more E’s than Z’s etc.) and assigned a random position on screen. They shrink and fade away after a set period of time, at which point they become unavailable for use in the player’s words.

###### In level two, the difficulty increases as the player is only able to use blue letters. In level 3, the player may only use red letters and words under 4 letters long are not allowed.

###### The win logic requires a submitted word to fulfil a number of conditions to be passed as a valid word:

###### * The word is a correctly spelt English word (checked against an array of English words).
###### * The word is made up of letters that are present in an ever-changing array of letters in play.
###### * The word has not previously been entered during the level.
###### * The word consists of 4 letters or more (Level 3 only).

```
function returnResult() {
  if (wordIsValid === true && invalidLetters.length === 0 && wordIsRepeat === false) {
    $wordLog.append($(`<span>${submittedWord}</span>`).addClass('green'));
    scoreUpdate();
  } else {
    $wordLog.append($(`<span>${submittedWord}</span>`).addClass('red'));
  }
}
```

###### If level 3 is beaten, the player is presented with a final score (the sum of each level score) and can restart the entire game and try to beat it.

I was pleased with the final product, which I feel looks good an plays well. The game could be developed into a larger game with new levels and challenges to further test the player’s skills.
